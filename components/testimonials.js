      'As someone who was completely unfamiliar with Beyond the Five before being suddenly thrust into the server, BT5\'s community was ridiculously welcoming and easy to talk with. From reading out Andy\'s messages in a falsetto voice to doing an impression of Dr. Seuss\' Cat in the Hat, I\'ve had a ridiculous amount of fun and I am looking forward to pushing myself to academic success with the BT5 team by my side.'

There will be other students for you to interact with, whether it\'s asking questions about the class or just having fun in general. The instructors are online and ready to support you if you are confused about something.'
